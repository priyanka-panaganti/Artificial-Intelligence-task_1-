Task-1:

1. Write a python program that reads from a file of real numbers, and displays the minimum, maximum, and average, of numbers in the file. The user should be able to enter the name of the input file from the keyboard 

2. Write a python program demonstrating the following: given two files F1.txt and F2.txt to read data. 

F1.txt 

Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects. 

F2.txt 

It is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured object-oriented and functional programming.

Output File: F3.txt 

Python It is is an dynamically-typed interpreted and high-level garbage-collected. general-purpose It programming supports language. multiple Its programming language paradigms, constructs including as structured, well object-oriented as and its functional object-oriented programming.  approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.

3. Write a python program that reads from two files containing list of integer. Display the number of elements of list in each file. Sort the contents of both the files (lists)(Use the built-in sort function) and display it and also write it to output file.

4. Write a simple python program to plot a graph.

5. Write a python program to plot the graph for the following equation:
                  y = x^2 + log(x/2) ,                    x = 1,2,……100
    Pass the input through a file.
