Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects. It is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured object-oriented and functional programming.
